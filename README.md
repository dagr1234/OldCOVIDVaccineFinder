# QuickCOVIDVaccineFinder
Simple Vaccine Finder

Very simple display of vaccines using a wonderful API called vaccinespotter.   I'm assuming there are plenty of apps out there calling this API, but just
in case I will submit this simple one to the app store.  Please make it better -- I have plenty of ideas to make it much better, but not at all sure there 
is a need.

Right now it just launches, calls the API and scrolls the results.  Clearly numerous improvements are needed and I'll create some issues for them.
